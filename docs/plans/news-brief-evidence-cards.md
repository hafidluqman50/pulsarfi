# News Brief Evidence Cards

| **Last Updated** | 2026-09-21 |

| Version | Date | Change |
|---|---|---|
| 1.0 | 2026-09-07 | Initial implementation |
| 1.1 | 2026-09-21 | In §2, §3, §4, §5: Resolve live verification blocker by replacing go-readability with Tavily Extract API as primary extraction engine in read_article, adding article.Node nil-check guard to readability fallback, expanding TrustedNewsDomains to include bisnis.com, and verifying with unit tests. |
| 1.2 | 2026-09-21 | In §3, §4, §5: Cap maximum tool errors to strictly 3 per turn with short-circuit circuit breaker in RunContext and WrapToolGraceful, and replace MaxIterations: 20 in analyzer/index.go with a lean limit of 6 to prevent on-chain ETH gas waste. |
| 1.3 | 2026-09-21 | In §3, §4: Simplify iteration and retry bounding — eliminate custom circuit-breaker complexity in RunContext/graceful_tool_service; directly set MaxIterations: 3 in analyzer/index.go to cap iterations/retries naturally and conserve on-chain ETH gas. |

**Note on scope.** A scoped-down version of a richer "News Brief" design reference the user shared (composite sentiment score, multi-asset comparison tabs, a quarantine view for rejected sources) — this covers only what was explicitly asked for in words: a dated, sourced, linked citation card per evidence item, reusing `TrustedNewsDomains` for legitimacy. The composite score/tabs/quarantine UI are not built.

## 1. Problem

Analyzer's real, sourced evidence (gathered via `web_search`/`read_article`, gated to `TrustedNewsDomains`) only ever surfaced as Supervisor's own prose summary of it, or buried in the Sub Task detail view's reasoning JSON — never as its own citation card with a source name, date, excerpt, image, and a link back to the original article, the way a real news brief should look.

---

## 2. Extraction Mechanism & Anti-Bot Protection

During live testing of news sentiment requests, `read_article`'s underlying library (`codeberg.org/readeck/go-readability/v2`) was blocked by bot protections (Cloudflare challenges / JS verification stubs) systematically deployed across Indonesian financial portals (`kompas.com`, `cnbcindonesia.com`, `bisnis.com`, `liputan6.com`). The raw Go HTTP client received challenge HTML where readability failed to locate an article node (`article.Node == nil`), causing `RenderText` to fail with `the Node field is nil`.

To resolve this reliably in production:
- `fetchArticle` now routes through the **Tavily Extract API** (`https://api.tavily.com/extract`), which handles headless JS rendering and anti-bot challenges natively.
- An explicit nil guard `if article.Node == nil` is enforced on the `go-readability` fallback to ensure low-level nil-pointer errors are prevented when running offline or without an API key.

---

## 3. Design & Execution Bounds

- `readArticleResponse` (`analyzer/tools_service.go`) carries `title`, `content`, `excerpt`, `site_name`, `image_url`, and `published_at`.
- `NewReadArticleTool` accepts `apiKey string, allowedDomains []string` and is instantiated alongside `NewSearchTool` in `NewNewsTools()`.
- `TrustedNewsDomains` includes `bisnis.com` to match all subdomains under Bisnis.com.
- `siteNameFromHost` maps domain hosts (`kompas.com` -> `Kompas.com`, `bisnis.com` -> `Bisnis.com`, `cnbcindonesia.com` -> `CNBC Indonesia`, `liputan6.com` -> `Liputan6.com`).
- `analyzer/instructions.go`'s evidence contract asks for `source`/`url`/`published_at`/`excerpt`/`image_url` per item, grounded in what `read_article` returned.
- `classifyReply` in `orchestrator_workflow_service.go` sets `content_type: "news"` when non-empty evidence items are present.
- Migration `020` adds `'news'` to `agent_chat_messages_content_type_check`.
- `NewsBrief.tsx` renders each item: source badge, formatted date (if present), excerpt, 64×64 lead image (if present), and link to the original article.
- **MaxIterations Capped at 3**: In `analyzer/index.go`, `MaxIterations` is set to **`3`**, directly and naturally bounding the maximum tool executions and retries to 3 without unnecessary architectural overhead or on-chain ETH gas waste.

## 5. Verification

- `go build ./src/...` and `go test ./test/service/agent/...` pass cleanly.
- `TestReadArticleTool_ValidationAndDomainAllowlist` confirms live extraction against Kompas articles using Tavily Extract.
- `TestReadArticleTool_FallbackNoKey` confirms that when Tavily API key is absent and `go-readability` is invoked, `article.Node == nil` is caught safely without `the Node field is nil`.
